# LokBot - Automated Game Bot for League of the Kingdoms

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING FOR REPLIT AGENTS ⚠️

**HIGH PRIORITY DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES:**

🚨 **DO NOT MAKE UNAUTHORIZED CHANGES** 🚨

1. **Follow Instructions EXACTLY** - Only implement what is specifically requested by the user
2. **NO Scope Creep** - Do not add features, modify UI elements, or change functionality that wasn't explicitly asked for  
3. **ASK Before Major Changes** - Always seek permission before making significant modifications to existing working systems
4. **Understand Before Acting** - Thoroughly analyze the existing codebase structure before making any changes
5. **Test Existing Functionality** - Ensure you understand how current features work before attempting modifications
6. **Preserve Working Features** - Do not break or modify existing functionality while adding new features

**RECENT LESSON LEARNED (Sept 6, 2025):**
- Rally Join/Start troops were ALREADY configured correctly (per-monster troops)  
- Agent incorrectly added general troops sections without understanding the existing architecture
- Caused confusion and required rollback of unnecessary changes
- Always examine existing code structure before assuming something is missing

**Remember: Users hire agents to be precise and follow directions, not to make arbitrary improvements!**
